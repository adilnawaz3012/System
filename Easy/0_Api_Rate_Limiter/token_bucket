- Ref: https://systemsdesign.cloud/SystemDesign/RateLimiter
- there is a limit of 3 requests per minute per user.
- once the 1 minute is passed, then the refiller will refill the bucket.


- Implementation of Token Bucket algorithm:
    - Each bucket has a few properties:
        - key ( a unique byte string that identifies the bucket )
        - maxAmount ( the maximum number of tokens the bucket can hold )
        - refillTime ( the amount of time between refills )
        - refillAmount ( the number of tokens that are added to the bucket during a refill )
        - value ( the current number of tokens in the bucket )
        - lastUpdate ( the last time the bucket was updated )
    - We can break that algorithm into three steps:
        - Fetch the token
        - Access the token
        - Update the token
